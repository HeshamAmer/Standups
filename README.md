# Standups
How to do Stand-ups more efficiently


# Stand up meeting
The daily stand-up meeting is an inherent part of agile development and can help a team and support its progress immensely. 
The nature of this daily meeting allows every team member to be always up-to-date about the entire team's progress and to get aware of potential blockers. 
In combination with agile development processes like Scrum or Kanban it can be a very powerful tool for the team. 
## The normal setup
A usual stand-up follows the scheme of letting everyone in the team answer three questions:
 - What did you do yesterday that helped the team meet the sprint goal ? 
 - What will you do today to help the team meet the sprint goal ? 
 - Do you see any blockers that prevent the team from meeting the sprint goal ?

Although the intention of these questions is to inform every member of the team about the current progress, the feeling of reporting to a supervisor is not fully gone, which is not too surprising given that it spawned from a mostly supervisor driven environment.

The stand-up meeting is a strong and powerful tool but as with every tool a team needs to check if the tool is suited for its work or if it needs to change it, Otherwise the result is a hammer and a lot of obstacles look oddly similar to nails.

While a lot of our teams changed some small things, Me and my team changed the stand-up meeting more heavily than others. The members of the team sat together and thought about what they wanted from a stand-up meeting and what elements are superfluous for their needs. 

In multiple iterations they tested out what works and what doesn't, threw out some ideas, while keeping most and came up with a meet-up structure that compliments their needs and workflow nicely, at least until they get a new idea they want to try out. 
## The approach
They came up with **three** changes according to the structure of the stand-up meeting in order to help them. 
1. Reserve some time to structure your thoughts Usually around 10 seconds Taking the time to properly think about what you are going to tell the other team members, allows to focus on the important part and being precise. It gives the needed time to the team member to be able to describe everything clearly and quickly, as well as make it easier for the audience to follow the chain of thoughts and understand the current situation. 
2. Don't tell what you did, tell what you will do.  
3. Don't use the word 'yesterday' 

**Stand-up is not a report**. 
Team members must not focus on the past, but instead concentrate on the future. The team doesn't need to know what was already done, because the report can be gathered from the board, The team needs only to know what's significant and important to them, although an exception for this is if the work done changed drastically compared to the plan that was said at the last stand-up. 

It's also important to note that with this approach there is no need to walk the board and go through every task individually in the stand-up. Tell what the team needs to know, nothing more, nothing less. 

It is very important to respect the time of the other team members by focusing on key messages and avoid details. They will appreciate it and it will create a sense of mutual respect in the team. If they want to know more, they can ask after the meeting or look at the board on the next day. 
## Findings
The result is a much faster stand-up, shortening it from the original 35 minutes to a maximum of 8 minutes while not loosing important information. At the same time the team doesn't get overloaded with information that they simply don't need and don't get the feeling everyone is more reporting than informing. 

These new rules allow the team to focus on the actual important issues, to solve blockers quickly and to cooperate more often. It is also important to note that the product owner is very satisfied with this new stand-up. It increases the productivity of the team and creates a sense of mutual respect. 

Such a heavy change is of course not only positive and while these changes helped the team immensely, it is harder for new colleagues to adapt to in comparison to the usual standup meeting, especially when coming out of a more hierarchical ordered structure. The changes made by this team are of course not meant to be used as a manual, but rather a suggestion and the advice to always think about your tools and if they can be made more helpful to your team.


## Result

In the end I feel happier that we did this change and now we really be more efficient when it comes to knowledge sharing
